# What is Jellyseerr?

Jellyseerr is a free and open source software application for managing requests for your media library. It is a a fork of Overseerr built to bring support for Jellyfin & Emby media servers!

# Installation
# tabs {.tabset}
## Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  jellyseerr:
    image: fallenbagel/jellyseerr:latest
    container_name: jellyseerr
    environment:
      - LOG_LEVEL=debug
      - TZ=America/New_York
    ports:
      - 5055:5055
    user: "568:568"
    volumes:
      - /mnt/tank/configs/jellyseerr:/app/config
    restart: unless-stopped
```

- **PUID / PGID**: Ensure you use a user/group with the correct permissions for accessing media folders. TrueNAS SCALE defaults to 568:568 for apps.
- **Volumes**: The container structure follows a common-sense naming convention, storing configurations under /mnt/tank/configs/sonarr
- ðŸ“Œ Refer to the [Folder-Structure](/Folder-Structure) guide for more details.
