<p><a href="https://github.com/Ravencentric/awesome-arr">Ravencentric</a> has an extended list of apps centered around the *arr suite which I want to bring some attention to. This is a fairly well maintained list, but some projects on here have been deprecated so make sure to visit the author's repo before installing anything. There is so much here I didn't want to try to make my own page about it, but rather redirect you to the repo itself so you can browse around and find interesting things you may want to add on.</p>
<p>The apps which I have included in my wiki are extensive enough to cover 99% of use-cases (in my opinion). However, there are always edge-cases which require a specialized solution you may find here. Happy hunting!</p>
