> Unfortunately, YouTube will not let me host all the content I would like for some of the pages on this wiki. [Get the full story here](https://blog.serversatho.me/youtube-vs-patreon/)
{.is-danger}


As such, I have a Patreon page for videos which are **most** requested, yet unable to be hosted on YouTube. Check it out at [patreon.com/serversathome](https://patreon.com/serversathome). Please comment on the channel for requests.

# Blog

This wiki mainly covers the software side of servers. This of course assumes you have a server in the first place. But if you need guidance on parts or building a server, please [refer to this blog](https://blog.serversatho.me).

# GitHub

For some of the code we would like to host, [we now have a Github repo](https://github.com/serversathome/ServersatHome) for everyone. Any links in this wiki which contain code will be migrated to the Github repo, as well as code from the YouTube channel demonstrations.
