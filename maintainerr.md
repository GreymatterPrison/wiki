# ![Radarr](/maintainerr.png){class="tab-icon"} What is Maintainerr?

Maintainerr makes managing your media easy.

- Do you hate being the janitor of your server?
- Do you have a lot of media that never gets watched?
- Do your users constantly request media, and let it sit there afterward never to be touched again?

If you answered yes to any of those questions.. You NEED Maintainerr. It's a one-stop-shop for handling those outlying shows and movies that take up precious space on your server.
