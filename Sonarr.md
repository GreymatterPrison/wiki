# What is Sonarr?

Sonarr is a PVR for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new episodes of your favorite shows and will grab, sort and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of files already downloaded when a better quality format becomes available.

# Installation
# tabs {.tabset}
## Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  sonarr:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/sonarr:latest
    container_name: sonarr
    environment:
      - PUID=568
      - PGID=568
      - TZ=America/New_York
    volumes:
      - /mnt/tank/configs/sonarr:/config
      - /mnt/tank/media:/media
    ports:
      - 8989:8989
    restart: unless-stopped
```
### Permissions & Folder Structure
- **PUID / PGID**: Ensure you use a user/group with the correct permissions for accessing media folders. TrueNAS SCALE defaults to 568:568 for apps.
- **Volumes**: The container structure follows a common-sense naming convention, storing configurations under /mnt/tank/configs/sonarr
- ðŸ“Œ Refer to the [Folder-Structure](/Folder-Structure) guide for more details.

## Profiles

1. Delete all profiles not created by Recyclarr
1. Change the default profile for Jellyseerr to the new ones created by Recyclarr
1. If you cannot delete a profile it is because it is in use by a series. Find out which series uses it and change it to the new profile, then go back and delete the old one.

> **Why use Recyclarr profiles?**
>Recyclarr automates profile creation and ensures consistent quality filtering, metadata tagging, and download prioritization for a better Sonarr experience.

## General > Backups

1. Navigate to the bottom to the **Backups** section 
1. Change the folder to `/media`

# Troubleshooting
## Sonarr Cannot See Media Files

- Ensure your volume paths in Docker match the root folder in Sonarr.
- Run to check file ownership and permissions:
``` bash
ls -lah /mnt/tank/media/tv
```
- If needed, change ownership using:
``` bash
chown -R 568:568 /mnt/tank/media/tv
```

## Permission Errors (Permission Denied)

Ensure your user (PUID / PGID) has access to the media folders.
Try running:
``` bash
chmod -R 770 /mnt/tank/media/tv
```

## Sonarr is Downloading But Not Moving Files
- Verify that your Download Client Path Mapping is correctly set.
- In **Settings** > **Download Clients** ensure Sonarr has access to the completed download folder.
