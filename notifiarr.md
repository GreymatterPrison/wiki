# What is Notifiarr
Notifiarr is a system that integrates with many applications to manage and customize notifications via Discord. You can monitor your network, services, servers, and more and be notified of issues or events.

# Setup of Notifiarr
1. Go to [Notifiarr](https://notifiarr.com/guest/register) and create a account.

1. Next it will ask you to login to Discord . This is used to setup notifications. I recommend creating a private server for the integration.
1. [Create a bot on Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/204849977-How-do-I-create-a-server)

1. Follow the instructions after you connect your Discord and Notifiarr (after you have created and connected the bot). It should bring you to your profile page:
