# What is Notifiarr
Notifiarr is a system that integrates with many applications to manage and customize notifications via Discord. You can monitor your network, services, servers, and more and be notified of issues or events.

# Setup of Notifiarr
1. Go to [Notifiarr](https://notifiarr.com/guest/register) and create a account.

1. Next it will ask you to login to Discord . This is used to setup notifications. I recommend creating a private server for the integration.
1. [Create a bot on Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/204849977-How-do-I-create-a-server)

1. Follow the instructions after you connect your Discord and Notifiarr (after you have created and connected the bot). It should bring you to your profile page:

# Integrating \*arr Apps
Once they are connected we are going to go back to your notifiarr instance to setup a Arr instance.<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77fec8b4-b4f2-4e38-9596-5272bc633d9f)<br>
*click the plus sign and put in your instance name, url, username and password*<br>

We are going to add notifiarr connection to radarr now. In order to get your api key for the connection go to the notifiarr website. Add a Integration and select radarr. Then go to your profile page and scroll back down and create a API key for radarr
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d3e2b85-0c0e-4e31-b856-545504b4e49b)
For the name of the Connection in radarr make sure to add a character at the end of it, any other arr's you might do will need a different character from this one as well. you you connect them go back to notifiarr website and open the radarr itegration.<br><br>
*Click this button*

Back in Radarr once succesful you should see two connections now.

We are now done with the connections. Everything else will be handled in Notifiarr.

The one I personally use is SQP-1 (2160P) 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9288825e-729a-4fc6-a3ea-09d31ec6b1ea)

Select it and it will load the config. I would not mess with anything unless you know how to work trash guides. Just Scroll down and click Save Profile and Sync
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8c83bb4-a459-46cf-abbd-e2cd2a086589)


On the next page click Sync Profiles
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af9b9bbe-b437-4840-a2ae-18567ae6195b)

That is it. It might take a couple of minutes to get it imported into your arr instance.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0e0454f-ef70-419e-89cc-05619c26ee03)

Once it is however you just select that when doing any of your arr work in radarr.
