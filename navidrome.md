# ![](/navidrome.png){class="tab-icon"}What is Navidrome?
Navidrome can be used as a standalone server, that allows you to browse and listen to your music collection using a web browser.


# <img src="/docker.png" class="tab-icon"> Deploy Navidrome

```yaml
services:
  #----------- MUSIC PLAYER -----------#
  navidrome:
    image: deluan/navidrome:latest
    user: 568:568
    ports:
      - 4533:4533
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      ND_SCANNER_SCHEDULE: 1h # Optional
      ND_LOGLEVEL: info # Optional
      ND_SESSIONTIMEOUT: 12h # Optional
      #ND_BASEURL: ""
    volumes:
      - /mnt/tank/configs/navidrome/data:/data
      - /mnt/tank/media/music:/music
```

## Permissions & Folder Structure
- **PUID / PGID**: Ensure you use a user/group with the correct permissions for accessing media folders. TrueNAS SCALE defaults to 568:568 for apps.
- **Volumes**: The container structure follows a common-sense naming convention, storing configurations under /mnt/tank/configs/emby
    - **Dockge**: you can pass the dockge ./config/ folder structure if you are using that instead
- ðŸ“Œ Refer to the [Folder-Structure](/Folder-Structure) guide for more details.

> Refer to the offical [Navidrome docker installation steps](https://www.navidrome.org/docs/installation/docker/) for further information on the optional environment variables.

That's it, there isn't much more to it but to ensure your music files are placed in the appropriate mounted path.

For music management and tagging, many users recommend using [MusicBrainz Picard](https://picard.musicbrainz.org/) or [Beets](https://beets.io/), which can ensure that your Navidrome library is as clean and well-organized as possible.
