# ![](/radarr.png){class="tab-icon"} What is Radarr?

Radarr is a movie collection manager for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new movies and will interface with clients and indexers to grab, sort, and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of existing files in the library when a better quality format becomes available.

# 1 Â· Deploy Radarr

Radarr can be installed using Docker Compose or directly via the TrueNAS SCALE Community Apps Catalog.

# {.tabset}
## <img src="/docker.png" class="tab-icon"> Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  radarr:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/radarr:latest
    container_name: radarr
    environment:
      - PUID=568
      - PGID=568
      - TZ=America/New_York
    volumes:
      - /mnt/tank/configs/radarr:/config
      - /mnt/tank/media:/media
    ports:
      - 7878:7878
    restart: unless-stopped
```
### Permissions & Folder Structure

- **PUID / PGID**: Ensure you use a user/group with the correct permissions for accessing media folders. TrueNAS SCALE defaults to 568:568 for apps.
- **Volumes**: The container structure follows a common-sense naming convention, storing configurations under /mnt/tank/configs/radarr
- ðŸ“Œ Refer to the [Folder-Structure](/Folder-Structure) guide for more details.

## 3.1 Media Management

| **Field** | **Value** |
| --- | --- |
| Rename Movies | True |
| Standard Movie Format | {Movie CleanTitle} {(Release Year)} \[imdbid-{ImdbId}\] - {Edition Tags }{\[Custom Formats\]}{\[Quality Full\]}{\[MediaInfo 3D\]}{\[MediaInfo VideoDynamicRangeType\]}{\[Mediainfo AudioCodec}{ Mediainfo AudioChannels\]}{\[Mediainfo VideoCodec\]} |

| chmod Folder | 777 |

## 3.2 Profiles

- Delete all profiles not created by Recyclarr.
- Change the default profile for Jellyseerr to the new ones created by Recyclarr. 
- If you cannot delete a profile it is because it is in use by a movie. Reassign the profile before deleting the old one.

> **Why use Recyclarr profiles?** 
Recyclarr automates profile creation and ensures consistent quality filtering, metadata tagging, and download prioritization for a better Radarr experience.

## 3.4 Metadata

Select **Kodi (XBMC)/Emby** and check the **Enable** box. Save and close.

ls -lah /mnt/tank/media/movies
```
3. If needed, change ownership using:
```bash
chown -R 568:568 /mnt/tank/media/movies
```
## 4.2 Permission Errors (Permission Denied)
1. Ensure your user (PUID / PGID) has access to the media folders.
2. Try running:
```bash
chmod -R 770 /mnt/tank/media/movies
```
## 4.3 Radarr is Downloading But Not Moving Files

- Verify that your Download Client Path Mapping is correctly set.
- In Settings > Download Clients, ensure Radarr has access to the completed download folder.
