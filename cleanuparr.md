```yaml
services:
  cleanuparr:
    image: ghcr.io/cleanuparr/cleanuparr:latest
    container_name: cleanuparr
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 11011:11011
    volumes:
      - /mnt/tank/configs/cleanuparr:/config
      - /mnt/tank/media:/media
    environment:
      - PORT=11011
      - BASE_PATH=
      - PUID=568
      - PGID=568
      - UMASK=022
      - TZ=America/New_York
```

The `BASE_PATH` variable is for reverse proxy setups but can be left blank.

## Permissions & Folder Structure

- **PUID / PGID**: Ensure you use a user/group with the correct permissions for accessing media folders. TrueNAS SCALE defaults to 568:568 for apps.
- **Volumes**: The container structure follows a common-sense naming convention, storing configurations under /mnt/tank/configs/radarr
- ðŸ“Œ Refer to the [Folder-Structure](/Folder-Structure) guide for more details.
