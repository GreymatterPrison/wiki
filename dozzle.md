# What is Dozzle?

Dozzle is a small lightweight application with a web based interface to monitor Docker logs. It doesnâ€™t store any log files. It is for live monitoring of your container logs only.

# Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
 dozzle:
   container_name: dozzle
   image: amir20/dozzle:latest
   ports:
     - '8888:8080'
   restart: unless-stopped
   volumes:
     - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
```
