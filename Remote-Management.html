<p>The *arr suite is really meant to be managed from a desktop, but let's be honest, some of us aren't at home 24/7. For those of us who choose to venture to the great outdoors, there's an app for that.</p>

<p>If you have an Android phone, you're in luck. The <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kevinforeman.nzb360">nzb360 app</a> is the one-stop-shop to managing your *arr apps (as well as any other apps you want to add) remotely. Note, there are paid features which I think are worth it, you can run this app completely free if you choose. This app integrates Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, and Readarr as well as any torrent client natively (and more), with options to add on things like Jellyseerr and Emby to its internal browser. This is a must-have for those who don't want to sit in front of their desktop when they want to make a change to their containers.</p>
<p>From the developer:</p>

<p>Note: since this app communicates with your containers, you need to have them accessible remotely using something like Cloudflare tunnels or a VPN.</p>
<h1>Emby</h1>

<p>Emby is easy to manage remotely due to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mb.android">the official Emby app</a>. I use this instead of putting it inside nzb360, but you could do either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the developer:</p>
<blockquote>

Emby unites your personal videos, music, and photos and streams them to your devices.&nbsp;<br><br>Get the free Emby Server at https://emby.media (required as part of your Emby install).<br><br>• Emby automatically converts your media on-the-fly to play on any device.<br>• Emby organizes your media into an elegant display with artwork, rich metadata and related content.<br>• Easily share your media with friends and family.<br>• Rich parental control and management features allow you to easily control access for your entire family.<br>• Watch Live TV and manage your DVR (with supported TV Tuner)<br><br>This app is free to browse your media collection and cast to other devices.
